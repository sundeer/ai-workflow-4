I'll help you implement the behavior defined in the create-invoice.md file. Let me first check the contents of the @docs directory and the create-invoice.md file.

Let me search for the relevant files:

I found the docs directory. Let me check the contents of the create-invoice.md file to understand the behavior we need to implement.

Let's set up the project structure and implement the invoice creation functionality based on the requirements. I'll create the necessary files and implement the core domain logic.

First, let's create the domain models and value objects:

Let's create the LineItem entity next:

Let's create the Invoice entity next:

Let's create a service to handle invoice operations:

Let's create a test file to verify our implementation against the requirements:

Let's install the required dependencies to ensure our implementation works correctly. I'll create a package.json file if it doesn't exist and add the necessary dependencies.

Let me check the root package.json to see what dependencies we need to add.

Let's install the uuid package to generate unique invoice IDs:

Ran terminal command

Let's run the tests to ensure our implementation meets all the requirements:

I've successfully implemented the invoice management functionality based on the requirements in 
create-invoice.md
. Here's a summary of what I've done:

Implementation Summary
Domain Models:
Created 
Money
 value object to handle monetary values with currency support
Implemented 
LineItem
 entity to represent invoice line items
Created 
Invoice
 aggregate root with all required behavior and validations
Service Layer:
Implemented 
InvoiceService
 to handle business operations
Added methods for creating invoices and adding line items
Included proper error handling and validation
Testing:
Created comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios from the requirements
All tests are passing, ensuring the implementation meets the specified behavior
Key Features Implemented
✅ Invoice creation with multiple line items
✅ Line item management (add/remove)
✅ Automatic total calculation
✅ Status management (Draft, Issued, Paid, etc.)
✅ Validation for business rules
✅ Support for different currencies
The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design principles and includes proper encapsulation of business rules within the domain entities.

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail or make any adjustments to the code?
