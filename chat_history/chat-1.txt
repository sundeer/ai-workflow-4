## Me
I would like you to review the files in @docs and implement the behavior defined in @create-invoice.md.

I'll review the files and implement the behavior defined in the create-invoice.md file. Let me explore the project structure first to understand what files I need to create or modify.Let me explore the existing project structure to understand what I need to implement based on the invoice creation requirements.Let me check if there's an existing domain folder structure for the invoice implementation:I need to implement the behavior defined in the create-invoice.md document based on the domain model defined in aggregates.md. Let's create the necessary files for our invoice management system.

First, I'll create the domain models (value objects, entities, and aggregates) as defined in the aggregates.md file.Based on the feature requirements and aggregate definitions, I'll implement the Invoice management functionality. First, I need to create the necessary model types and entities.

Let's start by creating the domain models for our Invoice aggregate:Now that I've reviewed the code and the requirements, I'll implement the behavior defined in the create-invoice.md file. I'll create the necessary components and domain models based on the aggregates.md and create-invoice.md documents.

Let me build a solution for the invoice management system.
